      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Macronutrients (Macros):</strong> In the context of health and fitness, macronutrients are chemical compounds that provide bulk energy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. This calculator focuses on daily carbohydrate, protein, and fat needs.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Another essential part of human nutrition consisting of vitamins and dietary minerals such as Vitamin A, copper, iron, and iodine. Micronutrients are needed in smaller quantities compared to macronutrients.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Protein</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Proteins are organic compounds comprised of amino acids, essential to well-being. Sources include both animal (meat, dairy) and plant-based (beans, legumes, nuts).
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Carbohydrates (Carbs)</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Carbohydrates are classified as sugar, starch, or fiber. They are essential for energy, with complex carbohydrates (from vegetables, fruits, whole grains) being beneficial.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Fat</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Fats, though typically viewed as unhealthy, have structural and metabolic functions. Healthy fats include monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and omega-3 fatty acids.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Daily Calorie Needs</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The number of calories a person needs daily is based on factors like height, weight, age, and activity level. The calculator estimates daily caloric needs using BMR/RDEE and activity factors.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>General recommendations:</strong> Limit saturated fat, avoid trans fats, and replace them with healthier fats. Daily caloric needs vary based on factors like gender and activity level.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        <strong>Average daily caloric needs:</strong> Men: 2000-3000, Women: 1600-2400. Actual needs depend on individual factors.
